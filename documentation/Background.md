# 1) Background Info
### 1.1) What is Trust?
Trust is when the computer does something on our behalf we have to trust it with our data. A trusted component is that which always behaves in an expected manner.  To make a component "trusted", you must establish some root of trust. A Root of Trust Measurement is the process of measuring (hashing) components on a system to validate their integrity. When establishing a root of trust, there are two primary schools of thought: Static Root of Trust Measurements and Dynamic Root of Trust Measurements.

### 1.2) SRTM
 SRTM takes place at system boot from firmware / bios. This process requires measurements of the entire boot sequence at once. This is both a good and a bad thing, because any changes to the any part of the process (including even bios settings) would cause the entire system to need to be remeasured. SRTM Starts with Core Root of Trust (CRTM), and works its way up the chain where each link verifies the next. In other words, SRTM starts by measuring the bios boot block and then moves on to measure the rest of the bios. 

### 1.3) DRTM
DRTM aims to address shortcomings of SRTM. DRTM creates trusted environment from an untrusted state. Essentially what this means is that regardless of weather or not computer was booted from trusted software, it uses hardware to ensure that no malicious software has been run. For this reason, DRTM takes place after boot, as opposed to SRTM, which takes place pre-boot. Intel’s solution for DRTM is TXT, which utilizes special instructions on the processor (SMX). AMD's solution for DRTM is called SVM. Trenchboot provides a solution for setting up DRTM for an arbitrary platform

### 1.4) Typical Measured Launch Process
The process for carrying out DTRM depends on your system. \
[Intel TXT Spec](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-trusted-execution-technology-intel-txt-enabling-guide.html) \
[AMD SVM Spec](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/24593.pdf)

### 1.5) Why TrenchBoot?
- Managing each of these components individually can be confusing
- Most DTRM systems are platform dependent
- Most DTRM systems can only measure what was loaded into memory with it at the time it was started
- Most DTRM systems support only one attestation action


# 2) TrenchBoot Architecture
### 2.1 Architecture Overview
*The full architecture overview can be found at [https://github.com/TrenchBoot/documentation/blob/master/documentation/Architecture.md](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/documentation/blob/master/documentation/Architecture.md)*
![Overview](images/Architectural_Flow.png) \
This diagram shows a general overview of the overall architecture of a TrenchBoot system. In Bootstrap phase the system environment is measured and that information stored in the dynamic PCRs, using whatever method is appropriate for the given hardware. The intermediate phase analyzes the information collected in the bootstrap phase to decide if it wants to continue booting and pass control to the target OS, or if it wants to stop immediately. If desired, additional evidence/measurements can be gathered in this phase. Once the integrity of the system is verified the TrenchBoot kernel passes off control to the actual desired OS to initiate the runtime phase.

### 2.2 Bootstrap Phase - GRUB
Typically, when attempting to establish a DRTM, TBoot is loaded in order to carry out TXT on Intel, or SEV is used on AMD. TrenchBoot instead utilizes its own system, which is a custom version of GRUB that has commands built in to carry out a TrenchBoot "Secure Launch". This customized grub introduces the slaunch and slaunch_module commands. A working example of the TrenchBoot GRUB can be found at [https://github.com/3mdeb/meta-trenchboot](https://github.com/3mdeb/meta-trenchboot). The custom GRUB is however unfinished and while it is running on AMD, it is not yet functional with Intel processors.

### 2.3 Intermediate Phase - Linux Kernel / U-ROOT (Initramfs)
The intermediate phase processes information collected in the bootstrap phase and converts it into normalized data. This data is eventually used to determine whether or not to boot into the target OS. The kernel and u-root initramfs together make up Trenchboot's "Security Engine", which is an intermediate mini-OS that serves to process data gathered by that bootstrap phase. During the intermediate phase, the kernel and initramfs work together to measure block devices, individual files, SMBUS/DMI information and provides unseal based, external device and network based attestation. Trenchboot calls this functionality secure launch (aka slaunch). The table in section 4 lists the specific repo and branch to use when building the kernel or u-root.

# 3) Practical usage
### 3.1 Trenchboot GRUB TXT Config with Serial Communication
*Note: ACM modules can be downloaded from [http://mirror.openxt.org/](http://mirror.openxt.org/)*

    menuentry 'TrenchBoot' {
            savedefault
            load_video
            set gfxpayload=keep
            insmod gzio
            insmod part_msdos
            insmod ext2
            set root='hd0,msdos1'
            multiboot2 /boot/slboot.gz loglvl=all serial=115200,8n1,0x3f8 logging=serial,memory
            module2 /boot/vmlinuz-trenchboot root=UUID=<your block uuid> ro intel_iommu=on loglevel=7 console=ttyS0,115200 nokaslr 
            module2 /boot/<your acm>.bin
            module2 /boot/initramfs-trenchboot.cpio
    }

### 3.2 Testing the System
QEMU has been tested to boot fully into u-root while simulating the Trenchboot kernel. 
QEMU For external u-root \
`qemu-systemx86_64 -kernel <kernel repo>/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -initrd /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio -append console=ttyS0,38400 -serial file:serial.out` \
QEMU with u-root built-in \
`qemu-systemx86_64 -kernel <kernel location>`

# 4) State of TrenchBoot
| Name | Purpose | Functionality | Repo
|----------|-----|---|---|
| Linux       | Kernel | The custom TrenchBoot linux kernel does include working code that allows u-root to function properly. This kernel also functions as a regular kernel in that when it is launched without SLBoot, the data required to begin the measured launch process is simply not exposed.   | link: [here](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/linux) working branch: linux-sl-5.5
| U-root | initramfs/initrd  | By default launching u-root should show “u-root” in big bubble letters along with a shell. The u-root the command to launch into a MLE is sluinit which can be configured to be called automatically. | link: [here](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/u-root/) working branch: for-upstream
| Grub | *expirmental built-in* secure multiboot preboot module  |  The custom GRUB seems to be unfinished but soon aims to implement the slaunch and slaunch_module commands. | link: [here](https://github.com/TrenchBoot/grub) working branch: trenchboot_support_2.04
